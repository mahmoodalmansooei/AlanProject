Welcome to The Alan Project's documentation!
============================================

**The Imitation Game** will be a major contemporary art exhibition curated by Clare Gannaway at Manchester
Art Gallery, UK, March-August 2016. Inspired by Manchester\'s rich history of computer science, it will
feature eight international contemporary artists exploring the theme of machines and the imitation of life.
The exhibition will be part of the cultural programme for Manchester\'s role as **European City of Science** in
2016.

Artist Tove Kjellmark (Sweden) is making a new artwork for The Imitation Game exhibition, opening March
2016, in the form of two **human-like robots** which will sit in leather armchairs in the gallery and converse
with each other on topics yet to be decided. They will **detect and acknowledge the presence of human
visitors** to the gallery through **movement and speech**. Tove is currently working with staff and students at
KTH, Stockholm, to begin the building process, and she will also work collaboratively with academics and
students at The University of Manchester to embed SpiNNaker technology into the robots to affect their
behaviour.
