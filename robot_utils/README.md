# Utilities

Package contains scripts for various utilities required when building a robot control system.
These classes inherit from nengo.Network.

- [x] Generic matrix multiplication
- [x] Vector difference
- [x] Cross product of two vectors

All of these utilities suffer from being very sensitive to radius values.
