Utilities
=========

Package contains scripts for various utilities required when building a robot control system.
These classes inherit from nengo.Network.

- Generic matrix multiplication
- Vector difference
- Cross product of two vectors
- Module that differentiates a function dependant on time

All of these utilities suffer from being very sensitive to radius values. 

These modules can be used as stand-alone modules or as part of larger networks.
