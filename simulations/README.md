#Simulations

This folder contains larger pieces of functionality pertaining to controlling a physical robot __independent of the actual implementation__ of it.

I am simulating a __right arm__ just because that is my dominant arm. 
Controlling a left arm would only require a multiplication of the homogeneous coordinates by [0 0 -1 0] (invert the z coordinate)
