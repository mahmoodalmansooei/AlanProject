#Simulations

This folder contains larger pieces of functionality pertaining to controlling a physical robot __independent of the actual implementation__ of it.

I am simulating a __right arm__ just because that is my dominant arm.

Simulations needed to implement the final robot control system (in increasing order of complexity):

-[x] 1DOF (Degree of Freedom) Arm (can be generalized for head movement)
-[x] 2DOF Arm (can be generalized to eye movement)
-[x] 2DOF Arm (with finger movement) 
-[x] 3DOF Arm (with finger movement)(can be generalized to head + eye movement)
-[ ] Action selection based on input coming from Raspberry PI
-[ ] Action execution based on previously selected action
-[ ] Computing target position (?)
