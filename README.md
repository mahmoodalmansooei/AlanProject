__The Imitation Game__ will be a major contemporary art exhibition curated by Clare Gannaway at Manchester
Art Gallery, UK, March-August 2016. Inspired by Manchester’s rich history of computer science, it will
feature eight international contemporary artists exploring the theme of machines and the imitation of life.
The exhibition will be part of the cultural programme for Manchester’s role as __European City of Science__ in
2016.

Artist Tove Kjellmark (Sweden) is making a new artwork for The Imitation Game exhibition, opening March
2016, in the form of two __human-like robots__ which will sit in leather armchairs in the gallery and converse
with each other on topics yet to be decided. They will __detect and acknowledge the presence of human
visitors__ to the gallery through __movement and speech__. Tove is currently working with staff and students at
KTH, Stockholm, to begin the building process, and she will also work collaboratively with academics and
students at The University of Manchester to embed SpiNNaker technology into the robots to affect their
behaviour.
